Hello! My name is Vivaan Rajesh and I am a junior at Hillcrest High School.
I am really passionate about computer science and have been coding with java for a few years
I am familiar with python, html, CSS, and a decent amount of flutter, pyTorch and JS
As if right now, I am trying to improve my pyTorch as I am doing research with it.
Feel Free to contact me @ vivaan.rajesh2006@gmail.com
Have a Good Day!!ðŸ‘‘
